#This is the official repo for my Skadis SVG generator

To use the software, you will need to download the .exe file and run it.
It currently works best on windows computers, that already have python installed. Update hopefully coming soon ish.

If you want to compile the program yourself, feel free, just download the code from the page.
Remember that you need a couple of libraries to run the code, if you build the app yourself.

#Sizing the cut
Currently something isnt work perfectly leaving the output files with a wrong size. This is easily fixed by placing the svg file
in your cutting software and scaling it to match the size you gave it earlier. Then everything is correctly scaled.

#Whacky geometry
The way that the holes are generated, leaves a horizontal line in the top and bottom of each. It doesn't affect the finished cut,
but I am working on a version, that don't do that. With the current version, it will slightly increase the total curring time.

This is my first big project, so i am figuring everything out as I go along, so please have patience if something isn't working.
i'm trying the best i can.

Happy cutting and printing
